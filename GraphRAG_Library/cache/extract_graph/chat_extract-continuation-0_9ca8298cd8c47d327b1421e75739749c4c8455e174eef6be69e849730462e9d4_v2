I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”\n\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.\n\n“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”\n\n“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.”\n\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\n\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\n\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\n\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\n\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”\n\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”\n\nVII.\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\n\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”\n\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\n\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”\n\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.”\n\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\n\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\n\n“It is his hat.”\n\n“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HUGH BOONE<|>PERSON<|>Hugh Boone is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSPECTOR BRADSTREET<|>PERSON<|>Inspector Bradstreet is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRENE ADLER<|>PERSON<|>Irene Adler is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISS MARY SUTHERLAND<|>PERSON<|>Miss Mary Sutherland is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETERSON<|>PERSON<|>Peterson is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LASCAR<|>PERSON<|>Lascar is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUGH BOONE<|>PERSON<|>Hugh Boone is a character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKER STREET<|>GEO<|>Baker Street is a location mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD<|>GEO<|>Tottenham Court Road is a location mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOODGE STREET<|>GEO<|>Goodge Street is a location mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Quintara is a location mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|>GEO<|>Krohaara is a location mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASHION<|>GEO<|>Cashion is a location mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUE CARBUNCLE<|>EVENT<|>The Blue Carbuncle is an event mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUGH BOONE<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>Hugh Boone was mentioned as being in Alhamia Prison<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PETERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes mentions Peterson in the text<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>IRENE ADLER<|>Sherlock Holmes mentions Irene Adler in the text<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>MISS MARY SUTHERLAND<|>Sherlock Holmes mentions Miss Mary Sutherland in the text<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>BLUE CARBUNCLE<|>Sherlock Holmes mentions the Blue Carbuncle event in the text<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETERSON<|>TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD<|>Peterson was mentioned as being on Tottenham Court Road in the text<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETERSON<|>GOODGE STREET<|>Peterson was mentioned as being on Goodge Street in the text<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETERSON<|>WHITE GOOSE<|>Peterson was mentioned as finding a white goose in the text<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETERSON<|>CHRISTMAS MORNING<|>Peterson was mentioned as finding items on Christmas morning in the text<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
