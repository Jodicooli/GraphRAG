You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\n\n“And how?”\n\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.”\n\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.\n\n“Ha! you find it so?”\n\n“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”\n\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”\n\n“On the contrary, this is the right side.”\n\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.”\n\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.”\n\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.’ I see nothing in that.”\n\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.”\n\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\n\n“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.”\n\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\n\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.”\n\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\n\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\n\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.\n\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”\n\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.”\n\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\n\n“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\n\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?”\n\n“The best possible.”\n\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\n\n“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?”\n\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.”\n\n“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”\n\n“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”\n\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\n\n“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.”\n\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.”\n\n“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_df1325726ac41251161b766516b49c2e6e39f4fbb92c735295a2c7facec22bc7_v2"}
