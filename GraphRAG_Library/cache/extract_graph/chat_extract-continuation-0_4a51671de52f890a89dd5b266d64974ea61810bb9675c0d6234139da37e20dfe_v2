You see this little book?”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”\n\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\n\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\n\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\n\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\n\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.’”\n\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\n\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.’”\n\n“What have you to say now?”\n\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\n\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”\n\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\n\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?”\n\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.\n\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\n\n“She told me to ask you.”\n\n“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\n\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\n\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.\n\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.”\n\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\n\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don’t know.”\n\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\n\n“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\n\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”\n\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”\n\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he answered with a sidelong glance.\n\n“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always awkward doing business with an alias.”\n\nA flush spr\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BILL<|>PERSON<|>Bill is a small boy who brings books to the salesman)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALESMAN<|>PERSON<|>The salesman is involved in selling geese and other goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a detective who assists in solving the case of the missing geese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
