I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”\n\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\n\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”\n\n“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?”\n\n“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”\n\n“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.”\n\n“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our client, rising.\n\n“I have solved it.”\n\n“Eh? What was that?”\n\n“I say that I have solved it.”\n\n“Where, then, is my wife?”\n\n“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”\n\nLord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\n\n“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.”\n\n“My dear Holmes!”\n\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau’s example.”\n\n“But I have heard all that you have heard.”\n\n“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”\n\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\n\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look dissatisfied.”\n\n“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”\n\n“Really! You surprise me.”\n\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\n\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\n\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\n\n“In Heaven’s name, what for?”\n\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\n\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\n\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.\n\n“Why? What do you mean?”\n\n“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.”\n\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all about it,” he snarled.\n\n“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\n\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?”\n\n“I think it very unlikely.”\n\n“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”\n\n“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You dragged them from the Serpentine?”\n\n“No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.”\n\n“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?”\n\n“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\n\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\n\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness. “I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\n\n“And how?”\n\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_329ba3822779a58aa11bf1a6143e565e26678009120f111bae8d623e350d04e6_v2"}
