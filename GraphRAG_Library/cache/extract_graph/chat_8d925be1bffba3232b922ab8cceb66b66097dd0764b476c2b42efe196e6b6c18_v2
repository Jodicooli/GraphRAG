Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\n\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\n\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\n\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”\n\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?”\n\n“I think that it is very probable.”\n\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\n\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\n\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.”\n\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\n\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.”\n\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”\n\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\n\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I call to-morrow?”\n\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\n\n“The doctor?”\n\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.”\n\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\n\n“Yes, at the mines.”\n\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.”\n\n“Yes, certainly.”\n\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\n\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.”\n\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\n\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\n\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\n\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said Holmes. “Have you an order to see him in prison?”\n\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”\n\n“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”\n\n“Ample.”\n\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.”\n\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8d925be1bffba3232b922ab8cceb66b66097dd0764b476c2b42efe196e6b6c18_v2"}
