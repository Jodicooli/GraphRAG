About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,” &c, &c.\n\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued, glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\n\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\n\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive.”\n\n“Of what?”\n\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?”\n\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\n\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.”\n\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\n\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\n\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\n\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.\n\n“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”\n\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\n\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\n\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?”\n\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\n\n“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”\n\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\n\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o’clock?”\n\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>PERSON<|>Hosmer Angel is described as a gentleman with specific physical attributes and clothing details)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEADENHALL STREET<|>GEO<|>Location where Hosmer Angel was known to have been employed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALZAC<|>PERSON<|>Author quoted by Hosmer Angel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY<|>GEO<|>City where a firm is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDIBANK<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Windibank is the stepfather of a young lady involved in the case)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARY SUTHERLAND<|>PERSON<|>Miss Mary Sutherland is the disappearing bridegroom in the case)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a detective involved in solving the mystery)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>LEADENHALL STREET<|>Hosmer Angel was employed in an office in Leadenhall Street<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>BALZAC<|>Hosmer Angel quoted Balzac in his letters<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>WINDIBANK<|>Hosmer Angel's letters were addressed to Mr. Windibank<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARY SUTHERLAND<|>WINDIBANK<|>Mary Sutherland is the stepdaughter of Mr. Windibank<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>MARY SUTHERLAND<|>Sherlock Holmes is investigating the case of the disappearing bridegroom, Miss Mary Sutherland<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
