However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”\n\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\n\n“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”\n\n“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\n\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\n\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.\n\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”\n\n“And how did you verify them?”\n\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà tout!”\n\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\n\n“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”\n\nIV.\nTHE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>PERSON<|>Hosmer Angel is a character who deceives a young lady into believing he is her suitor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISS SUTHERLAND<|>PERSON<|>Miss Sutherland is the young lady who is deceived by Hosmer Angel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES WINDIBANK<|>PERSON<|>James Windibank is the stepfather of Miss Sutherland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Holmes is a detective who uncovers the deception by Hosmer Angel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WESTHOUSE & MARBANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Westhouse & Marbank is a firm that employs James Windibank)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>MISS SUTHERLAND<|>Hosmer Angel deceives Miss Sutherland into believing he is her suitor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMES WINDIBANK<|>WESTHOUSE & MARBANK<|>James Windibank is an employee of Westhouse & Marbank<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>JAMES WINDIBANK<|>Hosmer Angel and James Windibank are connected through the deception of Miss Sutherland<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>Holmes uncovers the deception by Hosmer Angel<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>JAMES WINDIBANK<|>Holmes exposes James Windibank's actions<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
