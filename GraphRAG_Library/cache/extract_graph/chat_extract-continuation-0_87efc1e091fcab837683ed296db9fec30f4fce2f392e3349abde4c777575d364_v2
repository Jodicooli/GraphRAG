Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\n\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.\n\nThe banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\n\n“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\n\n“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.”\n\n“Have you it here?”\n\n“That is it on the dressing-table.”\n\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\n\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\n\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.”\n\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\n\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\n\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\n\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?”\n\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\n\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\n\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\n\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.”\n\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\n\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\n\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\n\n“I cannot tell.”\n\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried. “And my son? You give me hopes?”\n\n“My opinion is in no way altered.”\n\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?”\n\n“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”\n\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\n\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”\n\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\n\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\n\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a famous detective known for his deductive reasoning skills)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANKER<|>PERSON<|>The banker is a character involved in the case)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLDER<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Holder is the banker involved in the case)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISS HOLDER<|>PERSON<|>Miss Holder is the daughter of the banker)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The bank where the banker works)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKER STREET<|>GEO<|>Location of Sherlock Holmes' residence and office)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUMBER-ROOM<|>GEO<|>Room where the key to the bureau was found)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORONET<|>EVENT<|>The stolen coronet is a key piece of evidence in the case)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>BANKER<|>Sherlock Holmes is investigating a case involving the banker<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>HOLDER<|>Sherlock Holmes is working with Mr. Holder on the case<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>MISS HOLDER<|>Sherlock Holmes is interacting with Miss Holder during the investigation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLDER<|>BANK<|>Mr. Holder works at the bank<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLDER<|>LUMBER-ROOM<|>Mr. Holder found the key in the lumber-room<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLDER<|>CORONET<|>Mr. Holder is the owner of the stolen coronet<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MISS HOLDER<|>CORONET<|>Miss Holder is related to the stolen coronet<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>BAKER STREET<|>Sherlock Holmes resides and works at Baker Street<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>LUMBER-ROOM<|>Sherlock Holmes is investigating the key found in the lumber-room<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>CORONET<|>Sherlock Holmes is examining the stolen coronet<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
