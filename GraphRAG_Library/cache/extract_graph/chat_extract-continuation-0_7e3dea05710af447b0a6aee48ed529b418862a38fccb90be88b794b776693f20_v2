Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Was she in good spirits?”\n\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.”\n\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\n\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\n\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\n\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\n\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\n\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\n\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?”\n\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\n\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\n\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”\n\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s house?”\n\n“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”\n\n“And who is her maid?”\n\n“Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.”\n\n“A confidential servant?”\n\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.”\n\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\n\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”\n\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\n\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”\n\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?”\n\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\n\n“On your arm?”\n\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\n\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\n\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\n\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.”\n\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”\n\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\n\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\n\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”\n\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.”\n\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\n\n“You think so, too?”\n\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?”\n\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\n\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?”\n\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”\n\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\n\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LADY ST.
