A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\n\nâSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\n\nââI would go,â said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; âI would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.â\n\nââBut, madam,â said I, âI have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.â\n\nââIt is not worth your while to wait,â she went on. âYou can pass through the door; no one hinders.â And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. âFor the love of Heaven!â she whispered, âget away from here before it is too late!â\n\nâBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\n\nâThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\n\nââThis is my secretary and manager,â said the colonel. âBy the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.â\n\nââOn the contrary,â said I, âI opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.â\n\nâHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. âPerhaps we had better proceed to business, then,â said he. âMr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.â\n\nââI had better put my hat on, I suppose.â\n\nââOh, no, it is in the house.â\n\nââWhat, you dig fullerâs-earth in the house?â\n\nââNo, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.â\n\nâWe went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\n\nâColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\n\nââWe are now,â said he, âactually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EYFORD<|>GEO<|>Location mentioned in the text, approximately ten miles away from the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>READING<|>GEO<|>Possibly a large town within a radius of ten miles from the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLONEL LYSANDER STARK<|>PERSON<|>Character introduced in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
