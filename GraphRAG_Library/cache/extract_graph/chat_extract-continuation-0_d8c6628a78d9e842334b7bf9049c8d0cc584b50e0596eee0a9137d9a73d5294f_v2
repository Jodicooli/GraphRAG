As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.”\n\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”\n\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n\n“Frequently.”\n\n“How often?”\n\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\n\n“Then how many are there?”\n\n“How many? I don’t know.”\n\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\n\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it means?”\n\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”\n\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\n\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.”\n\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\n\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\n\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\n\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”\n\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARY JANE<|>PERSON<|>Mary Jane is a person who is described as incorrigible and is facing termination from her job)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIFE<|>PERSON<|>The wife of the speaker who has given notice to Mary Jane)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Holmes is a detective who is skilled in deductive reasoning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONDON<|>GEO<|>City where the speaker is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRENE ADLER<|>PERSON<|>A character mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Continent where one of the royal houses is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMAN<|>GEO<|>Country where the paper was made)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOHEMIA<|>GEO<|>Region in Germany where the paper was made)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARLSBAD<|>GEO<|>City near Bohemia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALLENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Historical figure mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGRIA<|>GEO<|>Location in Bohemia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTINENTAL GAZETTEER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A reference book used by Holmes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGLONITZ<|>GEO<|>Location in Germany)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGLOW<|>GEO<|>Location in Germany)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAPIER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>German word for paper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GESSELLSCHAFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>German word for company)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Initial on the paper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>G<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Initial on the paper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Initial on the paper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>T<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Initial on the paper)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>MARY JANE<|>Holmes is a detective who may be involved in the termination of Mary Jane<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>WIFE<|>Holmes is a detective who may be involved in the termination of Mary Jane by the wife<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>IRENE ADLER<|>Holmes is a detective who may be investigating Irene Adler<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>GERMAN<|>Holmes is a detective who deduced that the writer of the note is German<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>BOHEMIA<|>Holmes is a detective who deduced that the paper was made in Bohemia<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>CARLSBAD<|>Holmes is a detective who deduced that Carlsbad is near Bohemia<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>WALLENSTEIN<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned Wallenstein in his deduction<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>EGRIA<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned Egria in his deduction<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>EGLONITZ<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned Eglonitz in his deduction<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>EGLOW<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned Eglow in his deduction<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>PAPIER<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned Papier in his deduction<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>GESSELLSCHAFT<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned Gessellschaft in his deduction<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>E<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned the initial E in his deduction<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>G<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned the initial G in his deduction<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>P<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned the initial P in his deduction<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>T<|>Holmes is a detective who mentioned the initial T in his deduction<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
