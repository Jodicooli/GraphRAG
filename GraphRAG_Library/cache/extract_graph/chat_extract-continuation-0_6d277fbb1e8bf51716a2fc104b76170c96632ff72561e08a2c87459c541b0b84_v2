You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.”\n\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I observed.\n\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”\n\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”\n\n“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”\n\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\n\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\n\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\n\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\n\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\n\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\n\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\n\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.”\n\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\n\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?”\n\n“Well, but China?”\n\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”\n\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.”\n\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in explaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Holmes is a detective known for his deductive reasoning and solving bizarre cases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATSON<|>PERSON<|>Watson is Holmes' companion and chronicler of his adventures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JABEZ WILSON<|>PERSON<|>Jabez Wilson is a client of Holmes with a unique story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARY SUTHERLAND<|>PERSON<|>Miss Mary Sutherland is a character in one of Holmes' cases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>Country where Mr. Jabez Wilson's tattoo was likely done)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISHES<|>EVENT<|>Tattoo marks on Mr. Jabez Wilson's wrist)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>WATSON<|>Holmes and Watson are detective partners<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>JABEZ WILSON<|>Holmes is investigating a case for Jabez Wilson<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JABEZ WILSON<|>CHINA<|>Jabez Wilson has a tattoo that indicates he has been to China<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JABEZ WILSON<|>FISHES<|>Jabez Wilson has tattoo marks of fishes on his wrist<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
