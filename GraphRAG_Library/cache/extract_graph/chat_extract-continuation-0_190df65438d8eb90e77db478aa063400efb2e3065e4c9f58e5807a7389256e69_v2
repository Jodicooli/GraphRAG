Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”\n\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n\n“Your French gold?”\n\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\n\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\n\n“And sit in the dark?”\n\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\n\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\n\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?”\n\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\n\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”\n\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\n\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\n\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\n\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”\n\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\n\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\n\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.”\n\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.”\n\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,”\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY BRANCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City branch of a London bank where French gold is stored)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MERRYWEATHER<|>PERSON<|>Chairman of directors at the City branch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes, a detective)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH GOLD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gold borrowed from the Bank of France and stored in the bank's cellar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIGHT<|>EVENT<|>Time when the events take place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JONES<|>PERSON<|>Inspector involved in the operation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCHIE<|>PERSON<|>One of the intruders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN CLAY<|>PERSON<|>One of the intruders)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY BRANCH<|>FRENCH GOLD<|>French gold is stored in the cellar of the City branch<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MERRYWEATHER<|>CITY BRANCH<|>Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors at the City branch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>MERRYWEATHER<|>Sherlock Holmes interacts with Mr. Merryweather during the operation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>JONES<|>Sherlock Holmes works with Inspector Jones during the operation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCHIE<|>JOHN CLAY<|>Archie and John Clay are partners in the intrusion<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>ARCHIE<|>Sherlock Holmes apprehends Archie during the intrusion<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLMES<|>JOHN CLAY<|>Sherlock Holmes apprehends John Clay during the intrusion<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
