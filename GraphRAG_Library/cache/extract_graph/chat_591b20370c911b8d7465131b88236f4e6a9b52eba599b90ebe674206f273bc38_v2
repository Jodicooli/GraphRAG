A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\n\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?” she asked.\n\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\n\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.”\n\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\n\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.”\n\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?”\n\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\n\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.”\n\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\n\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.”\n\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.”\n\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?”\n\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\n\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\n\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.”\n\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\n\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\n\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.”\n\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?”\n\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\n\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\n\n“Do you know him?”\n\n“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.”\n\n“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\n\n“Yes, he did.”\n\n“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\n\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.\n\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\n\nHe walked\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_591b20370c911b8d7465131b88236f4e6a9b52eba599b90ebe674206f273bc38_v2"}
