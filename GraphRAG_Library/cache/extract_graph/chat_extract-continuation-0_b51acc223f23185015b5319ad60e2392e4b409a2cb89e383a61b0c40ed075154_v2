He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\n\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\n\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.\n\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—forever too late!\n\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.\n\n“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\n\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\n\n“‘In my own bureau.’\n\n“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’ said he.\n\n“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\n\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\n\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\n\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me have £ 200?’\n\n“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with you in money matters.’\n\n“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.’\n\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\n\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he. ‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\n\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\n\n“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\n\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’\n\n“‘Certainly not.’\n\n“‘She came in just now by the back door.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARTHUR<|>PERSON<|>Arthur is the son of the speaker, described as a disappointment and irresponsible with money)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Holmes is mentioned as someone the speaker is speaking to)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIR GEORGE BURNWELL<|>PERSON<|>Sir George Burnwell is a friend of Arthur who influences him negatively)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARY<|>PERSON<|>Mary is the niece of the speaker, described as a sunbeam in the house and a wonderful manager)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCY PARR<|>PERSON<|>Lucy Parr is mentioned as the maid in the household)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTHUR<|>SIR GEORGE BURNWELL<|>Arthur is influenced by Sir George Burnwell in a negative way<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTHUR<|>MARY<|>Arthur has asked Mary to marry him twice, but she has refused<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTHUR<|>LUCY PARR<|>Arthur mentions Lucy Parr in relation to the household<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARY<|>LUCY PARR<|>Mary asks about Lucy Parr's whereabouts in the household<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
