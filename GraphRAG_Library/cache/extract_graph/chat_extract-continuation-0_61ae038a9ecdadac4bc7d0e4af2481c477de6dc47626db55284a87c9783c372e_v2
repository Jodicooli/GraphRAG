Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\n\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.”\n\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\n\n“Here?”\n\n“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\n\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\n\n“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.”\n\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\n\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\n\n“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.\n\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”\n\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\n\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.”\n\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\n\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\n\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\n\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\n\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.’\n\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.\n\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\n\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.\n\n“‘Next Monday I have a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALEXANDER HOLDER<|>PERSON<|>Alexander Holder is a senior partner in the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, located in Threadneedle Street)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a consulting detective who is known for his deductive reasoning skills)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLDER & STEVENSON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Holder & Stevenson is a private banking firm located in Threadneedle Street)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THREADNEEDLE STREET<|>GEO<|>Threadneedle Street is a location in London where Holder & Stevenson is located)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALEXANDER HOLDER<|>HOLDER & STEVENSON<|>Alexander Holder is a senior partner in the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALEXANDER HOLDER<|>THREADNEEDLE STREET<|>Alexander Holder works at the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson located in Threadneedle Street<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>ALEXANDER HOLDER<|>Sherlock Holmes is consulting Alexander Holder professionally<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
