Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\n\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\n\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\n\n“But how will you look?”\n\n“I will not look.”\n\n“What then?”\n\n“I will get her to show me.”\n\n“But she will refuse.”\n\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\n\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\n\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\n\n“He is dead,” cried several voices.\n\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.”\n\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\n\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\n\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”\n\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\n\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\n\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been better. It is all right.”\n\n“You have the photograph?”\n\n“I know where it is.”\n\n“And how did you find out?”\n\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\n\n“I am still in the dark.”\n\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n\n“I guessed as much.”\n\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n\n“That also I could fathom.”\n\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRIONY LODGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Briony Lodge is a location where a significant event took place involving Irene Adler and Sherlock Holmes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRENE ADLER<|>PERSON<|>Irene Adler is a key figure in the event that took place at Briony Lodge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a detective involved in the event at Briony Lodge)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRENE ADLER<|>BRIONY LODGE<|>Irene Adler was present at Briony Lodge during the event<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>BRIONY LODGE<|>Sherlock Holmes was present at Briony Lodge during the event<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
