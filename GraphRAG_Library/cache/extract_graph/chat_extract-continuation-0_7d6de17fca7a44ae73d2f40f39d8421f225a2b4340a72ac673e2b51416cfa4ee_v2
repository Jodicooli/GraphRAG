It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\n\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am delighted to hear it,” he said.\n\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.”\n\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\n\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.”\n\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.”\n\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”\n\n“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\n\n“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes suavely. “There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.”\n\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.\n\n“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.”\n\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\n\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.”\n\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought that she would have been so carried away.”\n\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of tre\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MISS SUTHERLAND<|>PERSON<|>Miss Sutherland is a young, excitable, and impulsive girl who is easily influenced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>PERSON<|>Hosmer Angel is a missing man who is being sought after)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Holmes is a detective who is investigating the case of Hosmer Angel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDIBANK<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Windibank is a character involved in the case of Hosmer Angel)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MISS SUTHERLAND<|>WINDIBANK<|>Miss Sutherland is related to Mr. Windibank and is involved in the case<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOSMER ANGEL<|>HOLMES<|>Holmes is investigating the case of the missing man, Hosmer Angel<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDIBANK<|>HOLMES<|>Mr. Windibank is involved in the case being investigated by Holmes<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
