Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\n\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\n\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\n\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”\n\n“No, I am descending.”\n\n“I beg pardon.”\n\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\n\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\n\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\n\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\n\n“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.”\n\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.”\n\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”\n\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\n\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.”\n\n“Pray do so.”\n\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\n\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\n\n“You were travelling in the States?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did you become engaged then?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\n\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\n\n“Her father is very rich?”\n\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”\n\n“And how did he make his money?”\n\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\n\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?”\n\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\n\n“Have you her photograph?”\n\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\n\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?”\n\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\n\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\n\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\n\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?”\n\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\n\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Was she in good spirits?”\n\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.”\n\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\n\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\n\n“And did you observe any change in her\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LORD ROBERT ST.
